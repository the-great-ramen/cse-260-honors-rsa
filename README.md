# cse-260-honors-rsa
This is code featured in my honors college paper for CSE 260 at Michigan State University.
It features a Python implementation of the RSA algorithm, with a small (unrealistic) key created by hand using the original mathematics outlined in the RSA paper.
The code features decryption and encryption as well as a debug mode which will encrypt and then immediately decrypt a message.
